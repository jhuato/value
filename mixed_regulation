# Mixed regulation

How should I describe the mechanism that regulates the allocation of productive forces under concrete modern capitalism?  Following Samuelson's ``mixed economy'' formulation, I ensure the hatred of Marxists.  But it seems very apt.

Another term, perhaps even better, is that of ``combined regulation.''  The mechanism that regulates the allocation of the productive forces of labor in today's global capitalist society is a highly complex, combined mechanism.  It is a good idea to try and disentangle its more elementary structures:

1. Insofar as one element of the global social formation is capitalist commodity production, and it is certainly its dominant element, then the mechanism of production price formation operates, and it does so -- again -- as its chief element at the inter-industry level.  This is the form that the global value regulatory mechanism takes under conditions of global profit rate equalization.  If value (the regulatory mechanism of commodity production in general) operates globally, then it does so through the formation of production prices, i.e. through the process of global profit rate equalization that results from competition among the many individual capitals.  Over the very long run, the tendential force of this mechanism is certainly second only to the formation of the global proletariat as a class.  

2. Insofar as the national states, the multinational proto-states, and the weakly binding international legal framework, apparata that are in the last analysis under the direct or indirect control of the capitalists, constitute the superstructural element of the global social formation, and this superstructural element redistributes the productive forces and allocates them to an array of chiefly national political ends by fiscal and ``monetary'' means, often contradictory or in a sort of ``national state competition'' (that, in the extreme, erupts into outright wars), then this direct approapiation mechanism (the ``fisc'') also operates, modifying the ``pure'' effect of the production-price formation mechanism.  Here, we should think of the ultimate resultant, since (again) often times national policies collide with one another and represent waste of surplus value at the global level.

How does (2) alter the inter-industry production-price formation mechanism?  It impedes the geographic mobility of the productive forces, but does it impede its inter-industry mobility?  It does.  As emphasized by Emmanuel, one of the most important prices is, of course, the price of labor power (in fact, there are as many prices as qualities of labor power).  If workers cannot move across industries and across national borders due to factors other than relocation costs, then the price of labor power will not equalize.

Trade tariffs affect the mobility of productive capital (means of production) and commodity capital (inventories of consumption goods and means of production for sale).  (Building structures, ports, waterways, etc. are non-tradable.) National barriers (taxes, regulations, etc.) to international finance affect the mobility of money capital.  These are barriers to the equalization of profit rates across these various forms of capital.

[Conventional trade models (and a common sense understanding of how flexible capital is) suggest that there is a press-the-baloon effect (David Laibman) at work here.  If you place barriers to the mobility of ``factors,'' then in the presence of trade the mobility of ``final goods'' becomes the main way in which global profit rate equalization takes place.  The ``choice of technique'' in each industry adjusts to the relative cost of the ``factors,'' which reflects their varying endowment levels.  (Clearly, without trade, in true autarky, then you don't have any equalization whatever, but islands each with its own independent production-price formation mechanism.  Perhaps the ``natural experiment'' here is the Soviet/Eastern European socialism experience, though even in those cases where the penalties involved were large, there was a black market and illegal migration.)

[Also note that Ricardo's comparative advantage story is fine, as a description of cooperation among diversely endowed workers.  It is true in the material sense, labor cooperation level.]

3. At the level of particular activities or ``industries,'' there exist varying degrees of market power held by large individual capitals (e.g. transnational and multinational corporations), which allow these individual capitalists to temporarily dictate market conditions and pocket rents or super profits.  In the long run, the relatively stable source of these rents is technological leadership.  Legal monopolies not supported by economic conditions are not sustainable in the longer run.  As a consequence of these ``monopolistic'' rents (the term is inept, and should be replaced with ``market power''), the operation of the production-price formation mechanism is modified, not at the inter-industry level, but at the intra-industry level.
 

4. There may or may not be periods of relative stability in the ``balance of forces'' among these various elementary mechanisms.  But perhaps the constant is change.  Can the data available permit us capture the evolution over time of these various components in the global regulatory mechanism?  With all the provisos, we should use the data on ``government spending'' as a proxy for this.

In Marx's direct-price formation, the individual labor required to reproduce each particular class of commodities got aggregated in and through the mechanism of social formation (individual producers interacting with one another through the markets, by buying and selling their wares).  The center of gravity of the direct prices was the social average.  Take a particular class of commodities, and let $Q$ be the total inventory of the good at some time point, with $Q = \sum_{i=1}^n Q_i$, where $Q_i$ is the inventory level of the commodity (in its proper ``physical'' units) held by producer $i$ at that time point.  Now let $L$ be the flow of labor time, direct and indirect (duly ``reduced'' to ``unskilled'' labor), socially necessary or required to reproduce $Q$ from scratch, where $L = \sum_{i=1}^n L_i $.  Then, $\lambda = L/Q$ is the value of one unit of the commodity in standard labor time units at the given time point.  Let $G$ be the total amount of gold (or ``taxing power of the state'') held at the same time point, with $G = \sum_{j=1}^m G_j$, where $G_j$ is the gold inventory held by $j$ then.  (I know Marx said that the portion of the gold inventories that matter in determining exchange values was only the portion involved in circulation, as gold inventories exceeding the needs of circulation would go into hoards, and if they fell short hoards would be depleted accordingly, but this is an arbitraging process between the various uses of gold, so here I just assume the ``return equalization'' holds so the hoards are constant.) Suppose that the uniform labor time required to reproduce $G$ is $L_g$, so that each ounce of gold has a value of $\lambda_g = L_g/G$.  Then the direct price of the commodity (in ounces of gold per unit of the commodity) is given by: 
\[p = \lambda/\lambda_g = (G/L_g) / (Q/L)\]

If there are relatively permanent obstacles to the mobility of the producers from branch to branch, adoption of techniques, etc., the direct price will be altered accordingly, but this is basically it.  So, clearly, there will be some producer $i$ of the commodity with $(G/L_g)/(Q_i/L_i) > p$.  Tough luck!  There are winners and losers here.  Inter-industry, it all hinges on the (Smith) ``effectual demand,'' embedded in the concept of socially necessary labor $L$.  Basically, $L$ is given by technical conditions of production and also by the size of the (solvent) social need (or ``effectual demand'').    But the notion of technical conditions/social need (effectual demand) is something more or less stable, something that only evolves slowly over time.  Not the result of tiny fluctuations in demand/supply.  This is what Smith, Ricardo, and Marx meant -- I'd argue.  This is all very empirically or historically determined.
