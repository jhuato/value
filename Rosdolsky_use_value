Rosdolsky's work has been celebrated, and rightly so. However, have Marxists followed up on it?

Chapter 3, ``Karl Marx and the Problem of Use-Value in Political Economy[1]''

``Before proceeding to a presentation of the contents of the \emph{Rough Draft} we want to raise a methodological question which has been
very neglected in previous marxist literature,[2] the answer to which, however, contributes fundamentally to our knowledge of the \emph{Rough Draft}. The issue is that of the role of use-value in Marx's economics.'' (p. 73)

Obviously, one needs to be careful with the notion of Marx's ``economics,'' as Marx didn't view the study of society as fragmented as it appeared to bourgeois thought.  But neither Marx considered these division arbitrary.  They reflected or were the expression in the social consciousness of specific social conditions.  That aside, this is indeed a crucial issue.

``Among Marx's numerous critical comments on Ricardo's system the most striking can be found only in the Rough Draft, namely that Ricardo abstracts from use-value in his econoniics,[3] that he is only `exoterically concerned'[4] with this important category, and that consequently for him it `remains lying dead as a simple presupposition'.[5] We should now examine this criticism more closely. Strangely enough, it concerns not only Ricardo, but also many of Marx's pupils, as it has been a tradition among marxist economists to disregard use-value, and place it under the scope of the `knowledge of merchandise' (Warenkunde). For example, Hilferding in his reply to B\"ohm-Bawerk: 'The commodity is the unity of use-value and value, but we can regard that unity from two different aspects. As a natural thing it is the object of a natural science -- as a social thing, it is the object of a social science, political economy.'' (p. 73)

Yes!  The same can be said of Marx's Capital (though maybe not of Marx, as a lot of his thoughts remained in his head) and of Marxists misled by the sharp contrast between use value and value. And no, use value is not a natural thing. It is a social thing, though a layer of abstraction above that of a specific mode of production.

``The object of economics is the social aspect of the commodity, of the good, insofar as it is a symbol of social inter-connection. On the other hand the natural aspect of the commodity, its use-value, lies outside the domain of political economy.'[6]

Here's a German, an Austrian, but basically a German, who draws a stark contrast between use value and value, and thus discards value.  Saying that a commodity is a unity of use value and value doesn't mean we should only care about value.  We should care about how the whole sticks together, the contradiction but also the unity or identity of use value and value.  Since use value is not ``the object of economics,'' discard it, and focus on value alone.

``At first glance this appears to be simply a paraphrase of the well-known section from Marx's Contribution. However, how does this passage actually read in Marx? 

``[Rosdolsky quotes Marx:] `To be a use-value is evidently a necessary prerequisite of the commodity, but it is immaterial to the use-value whether it is a commodity. Use-value as such, since it is independent of the determinate economic form, lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy. It belongs in this sphere only when it is itself a determinate form.'[7]'' (p. 74)

Marx is clear here.  Use value in general (the content of value but abstracted from the social relations that form it as value as a necessity), ``independent of the determinate economic form,'' is outside of political economy, because political economy splits social life and focuses only on the ``economic form'' associated with commodity production, private ownership, etc.  Value is not outside of social science though.  It is definitely not outside of the radical critique of political economy from the perspective of the direct producers.  But even in the restricted narrow focus of political economy, use value enters into the analysis ``when it is itself a determinate form,'' i.e. when we regard use value in its connection with value.

``It must be conceded that the original differs considerably from the copy,[8] and that Hilferding's arbitrary reproduction of these sentences is tantamount to umsy distortion of Marx's real view.

``Or, we can take a more recent marxist author, P. M. Sweezy. In his work the \emph{Theory of Capitalist Development}, which is intended to popularise Marx's economics, we read : `Marx excluded use-value (or as it would now be called, `utility') from the field of investigation of political economy on the ground that it does not directly embody a social relation. He enforces a strict requirement that the categories of economics must be social categories, i.e. categories which represent relations between people. It is important to realise that this is in sharp contrast to the attitude of modern economic theory...'[9] 

``Sweezy's presentation does not differ substantially from that normally found in popularisations of marxist economics.[10] However, in his case the mistake is even less forgivable, as not only did he have access to the \emph{Theories of Surplus-Value}, but also the \emph{Marginal Notes on A. Wagner},[11] where Marx discusses the role of use-value in his economic theory in great detail.

``He says there on Wagner, `Only a vir obscurus, who has not understood a word of \emph{Capital} could conclude : Because Marx dismisses all the German professional twaddle on `use-value' in general [NB, JH] in a footnote on `use-value' in the first edition of \emph{Capital} and refers the reader who would like to know something about real use-value to `manuals dealing with merchandise'[12] therefore use-value plays no role for him... If one is concerned with analysing the `Commodity', the simplest concrete economic entity, all relations which have nothing to do with the object of analysis must be kept at a distance. However, what there is to say about the commodity, as far as use-value is concerned, I have said in a few lines; but, on the other hand, I have called attention to the characteristic form in which use-value -- the product of labour[13] -- appears in this respect; namely, `A thing can be useful and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his own needs with the product of his own labour creates, indeed, use-values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use-values, but use-values for others, social use-values." [14] [As soon as use-value is not specific and concerning the individual, but use value in general, a social use value, then we are talking value.  JH] Hence use-value itself -- as the use-value of a `commodity' -- possesses a historically specific character... It would therefore be sheer wordspinning to use the opportunity provided by the analysis of the commodity -- because it presents itself as, on the one hand a use-value or good, and on the other a `value' -- to add on all kinds of banal reflections about use-values or goods which do not form part of the world of commodities [in the way that standard university economics does] ... On the other hand the vir obscurus has overlooked the fact that I do not stop short in my analysis of the commodity at the double manner in which it presents itself, but immediately go on to say that in the double being of the commodity there is represented the twofold character of labour, whose product the commodity is: useful labour, i.e. the concrete modes of labour which create use-values, and abstract labour, labour as the expenditure of labour-power, irrespective of whatever `useful' way it is expended (on which my later representation of the production process is based); that in the development of the value-form of the commodity, in the last instance of its money-form and hence of money, the value of commodity is represented in the use-value of the other, i.e. in the natural form of the other commodity ; that surplus-value itself is derived from a `specific' and exclusive use-value of labour-power, etc. etc.  That is, use-value plays a far more important part in my economics, than in economics hitherto,[15] but N.B. that it is only ever taken into account when this arises from the analysis of given economic forms, and not out of arguing backwards and forwards about the concepts of words `use-value' and `value'[16]

``This then is Marx's view. It is dear from this that the traditional marxist interpretation of Hilferding, Sweezy et al. cannot possibly be correct, and that in this instance the authors mentioned above -- without knowing it -- do not follow their teacher, Marx, but rather Ricardo, the man he criticises.'' (p. 76)

``However, what is the basis of Marx's critique, and how should we actually interpret the objections to Ricardo which are mentioned at the beginning?

``To answer this we have to go back to the basic methodological assumptions of the marxist system.  We know that, in contrast to the Classical school, Marx's entire theoretical effort was directed at uncovering the `peicular laws which govern the emergence, existence, development and death of a given social order, and its replacement by another higher one.[17]  He thus regarded the capitalist mode of production as `merely a historical mode of production, corresponding to a certain limited epoch in the development of the material conditions of production'[18] and the categories of bourgeois economics as `forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production'.[19] 

``But how can theory arrive at a knowledge of such particular laws, which have only a historical claim to validity? And how can these laws be brought into consonance with the general economic determinants which apply to all social epochs since , 'all epochs of production have certain features in common', a fact which `arises already from the identity of the subject, humanity, with the object, nature'.[20] Consequently, nothing is easier than `to confound or extinguish all historical differences under general human laws', by picking out these common characteristics.[21] For example, `even though the most developed languages have laws and characteristics in common with the least developed, nevertheless, those things which determine their development' must express `the distinction between what they have in general and what they have in common'. Similarly the task of political economy is, above all, the investigation of the laws of development of the capitalist period, which it studies `so that in their unity' (the unity between this period with earlier ones through the features which they have in common), `the essential difference is not forgotten'.[22]

``But what constitutes development in the sphere of the economy? It is precisely that process in which it expresses its specific social character! `To the extent that the labour-process is solely a process between man and nature; its simple elements remain common to all forms of social development. However, each definite historical form of this process marks a further development in its material basis and social forms.'[23] Here it is the social forms which are the decisive factor -- as distinct from their naturally given `content'. They alone represent the active, forward-moving element,[24] for `natural laws cannot be abolished at all. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws assert themselves.'[25]

We cannot go any more closely here into the fundamental marxist
distinction between 'Form' and 'Content' in economics. (The influ􀇳
ence of Hegel's Logic is easily discernible here.2il) On e fact though is
certain : for Marx it is the economic forms which serve to distinguish
the particular modes of production, and in which the social relations
of economic individuals are expressed. For example, as he says when
22 ibid. p.85.
2a Capital III, p.88g.
24 Cf. Hegel' s Science of Logic, Volume II, P·79· 'Matter is determined
as indifferent : it is the passive as against the active . . . Matter must be
formed and Form must materialise itself - must in Matter give itself selfidentity
and persistence.'
25 Marx's letter to Kugelmann, I I July I868. Selected Correspondence,
p. Ig6.
26 The Russian political economist I.I.Rubin wrote in another context :
'One cannot forget that, on the question of the relation between content and
form, Marx took the standpoint of Hegel and not of Kant. Kant treated form
as something external in relation to the content, ·and as something which
adheres to the content from the outside. From the standpoint of Hegel's
philosophy, the content is not in itself something to which form adheres from
the outside. Rather, through its development, the content itself gives birth to
the form which was already latent in the content. Form necessarily grows from
the content itself.' (Essays on Marx's Theory of Value, Detroit : Black and
Red 197!1, p.I I7.)
The problem of use•value o 79
critiCising Ros·si : 'the "forms of exchange" seem [to Rossi] to be a
matter of complete indifference. This is just as if a physiologist were
to say that the different forms of life are a matter of complete indifference,
since they are all only forms of organic matter. It is precisely
those forms that are alone of importance when the question is the
specific character .of a mode of social production. A coat is a coat.
But have it made in the first form · of exchange, a and you have
capitalist production and modem bourgeois society; in the second, b
and you have a form of handicraft which is even compatible with
Asiatic relations or those of the Middle Ages etc.'27 For, 'in the first
case the jobbing tailor produces not only a coat, he produces capital ;
therefore also profit; he produces his master as a capitalist and himsel!
as 􀆰- wag:-la􀇸􀇴urer. When I have a coat made for me at home by
a JObbmg tatlor,'ior me to wear, that no more makes me my own
entrepreneur (in the sense of an economic category) than it makes
the entrepreneur tailor an entrepreneur when he himself wears and
consumes a coat made by his workmen.'28
And in another passage : 'The agricultural labourers in England
and Holland who receive wages which are "advanced" by capital
"produce their wages themselves" just like the French peasant or the
self-sustaining Russian serf. If the production process is considered
in its continuity, then the capitalist advances the worker as "wages"
today only a fart of the product which he produced yesterday. Thus
the differenc􀇵 does not lie in the fact that, in one case, the worker
produces his1:>wn wage, and does not produce them in the other 0 0 •
The whole difference lies in the change of form, which the labour
fund produced by the worker undergoes, before it returns to him in
the form of wages . . .'29
Hence it is the s eci 􀇶iaJ...fu.rms_QL pn>duction and dis􀇷ribu-l,/
tion which, in arx's view, constit,1,1te the real object of economic
analysis􀇸- and· it· is just this 'lack of the theoretical understanding
needed to distinguish the different form of economic relations' combined
'with a crude obsession with the material' which characterises
a) The form in which the tailor produces the coat for sale ready-made.
b) The form in which the tailor is provided with the material and a
wage by the person who wants the coat.
27 Marx's comments here refer to the following sentence from Rossi :
'Whether one buys ready-made clothes from a 􀅲ailor, or whether one gets them
from a jobbing-tailor who has been given the material and a wage, as far as
the results are concerned the two actions are perfectly similar.' (Theories I,
p.2g5.)

With this we come to the end of our methodological excursus.
Meanwhile the reader will have noticed that we have simultaneously
' ' answered - in very general terms - the question of the role of usevalue
in Marx's economics. How did that passage run which we
quoted at the beginning, from Marx's Contribution ? In its 'independence
from the determinate economic form' use-value 'lies outside the
sphere of investigation of political economy. It belongs in this sphere
only when it is a determinate form itself.' In other words, whether
use-value should be ranted economic significance or can on

p􀇷on. It is certain y an economic category to the extent that it
influences these relations, or is itself influenced by them. However,
apart from that - in its raw 'nat􀇶 characteristics - it fall's outside
the scope of political economy.L Or, as it says in the Grundrisse :
'Political economy has to do with the specific social forms of wealth
or rather the production of wealth. The material of wealth, whether
subjective, like labour, or objective, like objects for the satisfaction of
natural or historical needs, initially appears as common to all epochs
of production. This material therefore appears initially as mere presupposition,
lying quite outside the scope of political economy, and
falls within its purview only when it 􀃫modified by the formal relations
or appears as modifying them.'32

[8] Bernstein noticed this immediately and chafes Hilferding in his discussion of the latter's text (in Dokumenten des Sozialismus 1904 Heft 4, pp. 1 54-57) on the subject of the discrepancy between his formulation of the question and Marx's own. He writes, `Marx is not so daring as to throw use-value completely out of political economy', and if Hilferding does this, `then he stumbles from his lofty position as an interpreter of Marx into depths far below those of the university professors whom he holds in such low regard'. However, these sarcastic remarks do not obscure the fact that Bernstein himself had no idea how to deal with the discrepancy, and was only able to solve it through a convergence of Marx's theory with the economists of the `psychological school'.

[Grr.  The association with Bernstein and the `psychological school' is sure to push the buttons of Marxists.]

Hilferding's reply turned out to be very weak. `Use-value can only be designated a social category when it is a conscious aim of society, when it has become an object of its conscious social action. It becomes this in a socialist society, whose conscious management sets as its aim the production of use-values; however, this is in no way the case in capitalist society... However, although use-value can be designated as a social category in a socialist society it is not an economic category, not an object of theoretical economic analysis, since a consciously directed relation of production does require this analysis [i.e. the analysis of use value, JH].' (\emph{Neue Zeit}, No.4, 1904, pp. 110-11.)

[9] op. cit. p.26.
[10] The philosopher Marcuse goes to the other extreme when he writes, `when Marx declares that use-value lies outside the scope of economic theory, he is at first describing the actual state of affairs in classical political economy. His own analysis begins by accepting and explaining the fact, that, in capitalisms, use-values appear only as the `material bearers of exchange-value' (Capital I, p. 126(36)). His critique then refutes the capitalist treatment of use-values and sets its goals on an economy in which this relation is entirely abolished.' (Reason and Revolution, p.304.)

The arbitrariness of this interpretation is immediately obvious. In the first place the passage quoted from the Contribution is not concerned exclusively with classical political economy, but with political economy in general [What is that? JH]. Secondly, Marx nowhere states that use-values are only `material depositories of exchange-value', but rather that they are so `at the same time', which is quite another question. Finally, Marx never set himself the task of combatting the capitalist treatment of use-values, but rather of scientifically explaining the fact, peculiar to capitalism (and to commodity production in general), that for use-values to be able to satisfy human needs, they must first prove themselves as exchange-values.

[Actually, Marx did concern himself with fighting the ``capitalist treatment of use-values,'' the fact that use value, human need, human powers, are all subordinated to capital, self-expanding value.  Marx's Capital is about fighting those social conditions.  So Marcuse may be clumsy in his wording, but he has a point.]

Hence, `no society can go on producing, in other words, no society can reproduce, unless it constantly reconverts a part of its products into means of production, or elements of fresh products'. (Capital I, p. 711 (566). For this purpose, therefore, it must maintain a certain production [proportion? JH] between the growth of the industries producing the means of production, and those producing the means of consumption (Departments I and II in Marx's schemes of reproduction), accumulate reserves etc. On the other hand, in any society, a certain quantity of surplus labour has to be carried out by the members of that society in order that it may have `at its disposal, so to speak, a fund for development, which the very increase in population makes necessary' (Theories I, p.1 07). `If we strip both wages and surplus-value, both necessary and surplus labour of their specifically capitalist character, then certainly there remain not these forms, but merely their rudiments, which are common to all social modes of production.' (Capital III, p.876.) And finally, `No society can prevent the disposable labour-time of society one way or another from regulating production.' (MEW Vol.32, p. 1 2.) And consequently this material basis of the determination of value [NB: material basis of the determination of value. JH] will also have considerable significance under socialism. (Cf. Capital III, p,85 1 .)
