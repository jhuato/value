# Duality

Fixed point mathematics exploits the ``duality principle.'' Perhaps the most general form of this principle can be found in set theory:
\begin{eqnarray}
R -  \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i = \bigcap\limits_{i=i}^n (R - A_i),
R -  \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n A_i = \bigcup\limits_{i=i}^n (R - A_i),
\end{eqnarray}

where $n$ may go to infinity. ``In words, the complement of a union equals the intersection of the complements, and the complement of an intersection equals the union of the complements.''  Therefore, ``any theorem involving a family of subsets of a fixed set $R$ can be converted \emph{automatically} into another `dual' theorem by replacing all subsets by their complements, all unions by intersections and all intersections by unions.''\footnote{Kolmogorov, A. N. and S. V. Fomin (2012), \emph{Introductory Real Analysis}, Translated by Richard A. Silverman, Dover.}

In microeconomics, the duality principle has become a workhorse via its applications in mathematical optimization under the convexity assumption.

In simple terms, the idea is that if humans are purposeful in their actions (the labor assumption), the production of subjective labor power (aka, consumption) is described by a convex mapping $U(x)$, where $x$ is the vector of actions (the choice of labor expenditure and consumption levels), and the production of means of production and consumption goods is described by a convex mapping $F(x)$ (the inputs of production are the outputs of consumption and vice versa), then $x^*$ (and, therefore, $p^*$), the joint optimal choice of production and consumption actions $x^*$ (with its associated vector of ``equilibrium' prices'' $p^*$) can be obtained (1) by the direct maximization of $U(x)$ subject to $F(x)$ or, alternatively, (2) by the minimization of $E(x)$, where $E$ is the consumption-expenditure mapping subject to the cost function $C(x)$, or (3) by the maximization of production $F(x)$ subject to $U(x)$, or (4) by the minimization of cost $C(x)$ subject to $E(x)$.  In other words, under the convexity conditions, the vector of ``equilibrium prices'' $p^*$ is the dual of the optimal ``allocation'' vector $x^*$, and vice versa.

The principle of duality extends to generalizations such as constrained static optimization (the Lagrangian multiplier is the dual of the technological or budget constraints), dynamic optimization (the co-state of the Hamiltonian signifies the dual of the dynamic constraint, cf. Dorfman), and convex games (cf. Intriligator).
