How to characterize the process or ``mechanism'' that regulates the allocation of productive forces in today's global capitalist society?

I may say it is a ``mixed regulatory process,'' in contrast with the notion of an ``ensemble of articulated mechanisms.'' The term ``mixture'' suggests the existence of a less ``mechanical'' and more ``chemical'' phenomenon, just a notch below a full-fledged ``chemical reaction'': costly to reverse if not irreversible, governed by the entropy law, etc.  Yet the term may remind readers of Samuelson's formula: the ``mixed economy.''

Perhaps less likely to elicit rejection among Marxists is the adjective ``combined,'' as in ``uneven and combined development.''  A ``combination'' may also suggest ``chemical bonding.'' Be that as it may, taken as a totality, the effective process that regulates the allocation of the productive forces in today's global capitalist society is a dynamic, highly complex, combined or mixed, regulatory process.

The analysis should reveal the more elementary structures that constitute this process when regarded as a concrete historical totality.

But before one looks at the elementary structures of the process, I must make an important general argument.  

With its ``mechanistic'' and ``static'' echoes, the term ``equilibrium'' elicits rejection among many Marxists, but to the extent global capitalist society exists and persists over a relatively prolonged historical period, one can conceive of its reproduction over time as a sequence of ``equilibria.''  In mathematical terms, a sequence of ``equilibria'' is a sequence of ``fixed points.''

The following argument is not a rigorous logical deduction, but rather a plausible inductive argument.  Assume discrete time and let $x_t$ be a vector that fully describes the state of global capitalist society at $t$.\footnote{A number of Marxists believe that a complex capitalist social formation is not susceptible to quantification.  The reason---it is alleged or insinuated---is that there are aspects of this complex totality that cannot be quantified \emph{in principle}, that therefore it is mistaken to try to capture the manifold material and social conditions of a capitalist society (economic, legal, political, moral, aesthetic, ideological, etc.) in a vector or list of numbers, even if one makes the list very long.  Quantifying is viewed as forcing a concrete phenomenon into a rigid, dry, and gray scheme that sacrifices its multifaceted, polychromatic richness, insidiously giving the unwarranted, false impression of ``mathematical precision.'' However, this attitude reveals an abject failure of abstraction.  Those who entertain it confuse the difficulty of precise measurement, a practical problem that can only be solved by the progressive improvement of the methods, techniques, and instruments of measurement, a process that interacts with the evolution of scientific categorization (cf. Von Neuman on the progression from believing that ``heat'' was unquantifiable in principle to its eventual measurement, a step that required conceiving of heat, not as a homogeneous entity, but as a structure composed of at least two distinctive ``elements,'' which were then categorized as ``temperature'' and ``energy,'' etc.), with the impossibility of categorization itself, since categorization or conceptualization, the identification of qualities involves \emph{ipso facto} the definition of quantities, is at the center of human cognition in general.  As soon as some aspect of a real phenomenon is categorized, i.e. its quality is identified, the topological boundaries that define it as what it is by contrast to what it is not, then its quantification is implied.  Any and all qualities are necessarily quantifiable.  In general, there can be no quality without quantity, nor can there be quantity without quality.  Quality and quantity are two intertwined aspects of the same dialectical unity.  Quantification is, simply, comparability against a conventional norm of the same quality, and at the very least a thing can be compared to itself. In the extreme or ``degenerate'' case when a quality is so rigid that it does not admit even the slightest quantitative variation, its quantitative domain is then binary, with possible values $1$ (i.e. the quality exists) and $0$ (the quality does not exist).}  The continuous time-dependent function $x_{t+1} = f_t(x_t)$ denotes in a stylized manner the transformation of $x$ from period $t$ to the next period $t+1$.  In canonical Hegelian terms, function $f_t$ captures the ``becoming'' of a new capitalist society over time as a result of the self negation of the old capitalist society, its transition from ``being'' to ``nothing,'' and the transition of the new one from ``nothing'' to ``being.''

In general, as a concrete historical totality, $x_{t+1} \neq x_t$.  The difference $\delta x_{t+1} = x_{t+1} - x_t$ captures fully the social change involved.  However, to the extent both $x_t$ and $x_{t+1}$ are versions of one and the same $x$, the function $f_t$ ``maps'' $x$ to itself!  In other words, there is a sense in which global \emph{capitalist} society remains identical to itself in spite of its change over time.  And that sense refers to its invariable \emph{qualitative} essence, the aspect of itself that identifies it as \emph{capitalist} from time period to time period.

This is the sense in which one can conceive the process of capitalist development, the cycle of capitalist reproduction, as a sequence of fixed points on a time continuum. In other words, this is a sense in which the following holds:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq: fixpoint}
x^* = f(x^*),
\end{eqnarray}

where $x^*$ need not be unique.  Note that $f$ captures a process of social self transformation.  In general $f(x) \neq x$, yet out of all the possible values of $x$, there is at least one $x = x^*$ such that $f(x^*) = x^*$ and that is the actual value of $x$ ``chosen by history'' so that capitalist society remains capitalist instead of turning into something else.  (The trivial case is $x=0$, which one can rule out by assuming $x \neq 0$.)

[This is the most general way in which I can invoke the analytical machinery of fixed points.  One other way, perhaps more natural, is to view the process of capitalist reproduction as having a production $p$ and consumption $c$ sides, with vector $x$ capturing the discrepancy between them $x = c - p$.  This is akin to double-entry accounting, where every transaction is matched on its ``source'' and on its ``use'' (``origin'' and ``destination'').  I can then follow Ross, general equilibrium story.  I then need quantities (use values) and measures of relative social importance (``prices'').  Why not ``values''?  Because the regulatory mechanism is combined.  So it's not just markets. Etc.]

Note that I have removed the subindex $t$ denoting the time dependence of $f$, as the function involved here would be one that leaves $x^*$ intact after the transformation.  It is a transformation of $x^*$ into itself for each period in the time continuum.


there must exist an ``equilibrating'' or ``balancing'' process at play that enforces equation (\ref{eq: fixpoint}) for each time period.

Furthermore, when one takes into consideration that global capitalist society (again, defined as a global society dominated by capitalist production) has been reproducing itself continuously since the 16th century, then one cannot avoid the impression that capitalism has demonstrated its secular historical permanence.  If the rule of capitalist production in the world had been historically ephemeral, one could plausibly claim that the sequence of fixed points involved was merely accidental, the result of a fortuitous, short-lived combination of circumstances.  However, in a human historical scale, almost four centuries of capitalist hegemony suggests historical necessity.  This is why one may infer that the centripetal forces that make the social formation stick systematically overwhelm its centrifugal forces, i.e. that the fixed points in the said sequence are ``attractors.''  Think of water finding its way down to the bottom river basin 

what is involved here is not only the ``existence'' of this sequence of equilibria or fixed points, but their ``dynamic stability'' as well.  In other words, 

In other words, we must be in the presence of a sequence of ``attractive fixed points,'' i.e. values of $x$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$ tend to ``pull'' $x$ toward $x^*$.  A sequence of ``attractive fixed points'' is a sequence of ``equilibria.'' 

If there exist equilibria (and, again, the historical, secular persistence of capitalism testifies to this), and the equilibria is not some ``corner equilibria'' (e.g. $x^*=0$ or $x^* \rightarrow \infty$) then it is likely that the function $f$ is indeed continuous and convex in the relevant range of $x$.  

I admit that this is not an entirely rigorous argument, since continuity and convexity are sufficient, though not necessary, conditions for the fixed point to exist.  This is inductive, not deductive reasoning.  

In other words, the discontinuity and nonconvexity of $f$ does not necessarily make the fixed point impossible.  It just removes its necessity.  My argument is that, if capitalism has been able to replicate itself for almost half a millennium, then it is likely that in the relevant scale of historical events $f$ is both continuous and convex.





 then the persistence of the essential capitalist quality of our global society is represented as the fixed point:
\[ x^* = f_t(x^*) \]

To the extent our global capitalist society reproduces itself as such, as a capitalist society, at each time point or for each given time period, transforming itself in some manner yet retaining its \emph{capitalist} quality, i.e. continuing to be dominated by the \emph{capitalist} mode of production as it has happened since the 16th century, then one is authorized to think of this reproduction as a sequence of ``fixed points'' on a time continuum.



In mathematics, the fixed point of a function is an element of its domain set that maps to itself.  



The existence and persistence of these fixed points in secular time implies that 

 duality between productive-force allocations (the concrete use-value composition of wealth, capital, productive forces in general existing at a given time point in society) and the actual or effective measure of their concrete relative social importance (their ``shadow prices'').  

Said differently, the actions (of production, exchange, and consumption) undertaken by individual in society, broadly speaking by workers and the capitalists (inclusive of all other nonworking social classes and groups), as these actions translate into an effective use-value composition of existing wealth (inclusive of capital), or a certain use-value composition of the existing productive forces, reveal the relative priorities of society, the relative social importance of each of these items.  (A Biblical reference, Matthew 7:16, is appropriate here: ``By their fruits you will recognize them.'')

This means that, one way or another, the existing allocation of wealth and capital (productive forces of labor in disguise) entails specific ``shadow prices.''  These are not merely ``monetary'' prices, but something even more concrete and empirical, since money is just a bond subject to all sorts of constraints (technological, economic, legal, political, moral, aesthetical, ideological).  These ``shadow prices'' at each point in time (the dual of the existing composition of wealth, capital, productive forces at such point in time) are subject to variations that prove to be temporary and others that prove to be more stable over time.  These variations result from all sorts of influences: At the deeper level, relatively stable technical conditions and effectual demands.  At the more superficial level, the same but subject to temporary variation.  At an even more superficial level, variations in everything else, i.e. legal conditions (economic policies, taxation, regulation, etc.), political conditions, etc.

Let us try to disentangle the more elementary components of this process, each component a complex structure:

One other point is that, in Marx's framework (following Ricardo and Smith), the distinction between market price and production price is one between a relatively stable ``center of gravity'' in contrast with exchange value fluctuations that are buffetted by temporary (``empirically accidental'') changes in the technical conditions of production and in Smith's effectual demands (or size of social needs), the two determinants of $L$ the total amount of labor time socially required or necessary to reproduce a given amount of commodities.  So, the $L$ and $Q$ that Marx cared about were the $L$ and $Q$ that had a measure of stability over time, as a sort of ``empirical'' time-series average. 

1. Insofar as the dominant element of the global social formation is capitalist commodity production, the chief component of the mixed regulatory mechanism of productive force allocation in today's global capitalist society is the mechanism of production-price formation.


operates, and it does so -- again -- as its chief element at the inter-industry level.  This is the form that the global value regulatory mechanism takes under conditions of global profit rate equalization.  If value (the regulatory mechanism of commodity production in general) operates globally, then it does so through the formation of production prices, i.e. through the process of global profit rate equalization that results from competition among the many individual capitals.  Over the very long run, the tendential force of this mechanism is certainly second only to the formation of the global proletariat as a class.  

2. Insofar as the national states, the multinational proto-states, and the weakly binding international legal framework, apparata that are in the last analysis under the direct or indirect control of the capitalists, constitute the superstructural element of the global social formation, and this superstructural element redistributes the productive forces and allocates them to an array of chiefly national political ends by fiscal and ``monetary'' means, often contradictory or in a sort of ``national state competition'' (that, in the extreme, erupts into outright wars), then this direct approapiation mechanism (the ``fisc'') also operates, modifying the ``pure'' effect of the production-price formation mechanism.  Here, we should think of the ultimate resultant, since (again) often times national policies collide with one another and represent waste of surplus value at the global level.

How does (2) alter the inter-industry production-price formation mechanism?  It impedes the geographic mobility of the productive forces, but does it impede its inter-industry mobility?  It does.  As emphasized by Emmanuel, one of the most important prices is, of course, the price of labor power (in fact, there are as many prices as qualities of labor power).  If workers cannot move across industries and across national borders due to factors other than relocation costs, then the price of labor power will not equalize.

Trade tariffs affect the mobility of productive capital (means of production) and commodity capital (inventories of consumption goods and means of production for sale).  (Building structures, ports, waterways, etc. are non-tradable.) National barriers (taxes, regulations, etc.) to international finance affect the mobility of money capital.  These are barriers to the equalization of profit rates across these various forms of capital.

[Conventional trade models (and a common sense understanding of how flexible capital is) suggest that there is a press-the-baloon effect (David Laibman) at work here.  If you place barriers to the mobility of ``factors,'' then in the presence of trade the mobility of ``final goods'' becomes the main way in which global profit rate equalization takes place.  The ``choice of technique'' in each industry adjusts to the relative cost of the ``factors,'' which reflects their varying endowment levels.  (Clearly, without trade, in true autarky, then you don't have any equalization whatever, but islands each with its own independent production-price formation mechanism.  Perhaps the ``natural experiment'' here is the Soviet/Eastern European socialism experience, though even in those cases where the penalties involved were large, there was a black market and illegal migration.)

[Also note that Ricardo's comparative advantage story is fine, as a description of cooperation among diversely endowed workers.  It is true in the material sense, labor cooperation level.]

3. At the level of particular activities or ``industries,'' there exist varying degrees of market power held by large individual capitals (e.g. transnational and multinational corporations), which allow these individual capitalists to temporarily dictate market conditions and pocket rents or super profits.  In the long run, the relatively stable source of these rents is technological leadership.  Legal monopolies not supported by economic conditions are not sustainable in the longer run.  As a consequence of these ``monopolistic'' rents (the term is inept, and should be replaced with ``market power''), the operation of the production-price formation mechanism is modified, not at the inter-industry level, but at the intra-industry level.
 

4. There may or may not be periods of relative stability in the ``balance of forces'' among these various elementary mechanisms.  But perhaps the constant is change.  Can the data available permit us capture the evolution over time of these various components in the global regulatory mechanism?  With all the provisos, we should use the data on ``government spending'' as a proxy for this.

* * *

In Marx's direct-price formation, the individual labor required to reproduce each particular class of commodities got aggregated in and through the mechanism of social formation (individual producers interacting with one another through the markets, by buying and selling their wares).  The center of gravity of the direct prices was the social average.  Take a particular class of commodities, and let $Q$ be the total inventory of the good at some time point, with $Q = \sum_{i=1}^n Q_i$, where $Q_i$ is the inventory level of the commodity (in its proper ``physical'' units) held by producer $i$ at that time point.  Now let $L$ be the flow of labor time, direct and indirect (duly ``reduced'' to ``unskilled'' labor), socially necessary or required to reproduce $Q$ from scratch, where $L = \sum_{i=1}^n L_i $.  Then, $\lambda = L/Q$ is the value of one unit of the commodity in standard labor time units at the given time point.  Let $G$ be the total amount of gold (or ``taxing power of the state'') held at the same time point, with $G = \sum_{j=1}^m G_j$, where $G_j$ is the gold inventory held by $j$ then.  (I know Marx said that the portion of the gold inventories that matter in determining exchange values was only the portion involved in circulation, as gold inventories exceeding the needs of circulation would go into hoards, and if they fell short hoards would be depleted accordingly, but this is an arbitraging process between the various uses of gold, so here I just assume the ``return equalization'' holds so the hoards are constant.) Suppose that the uniform labor time required to reproduce $G$ is $L_g$, so that each ounce of gold has a value of $\lambda_g = L_g/G$.  Then the direct price of the commodity (in ounces of gold per unit of the commodity) is given by: 
\[p = \lambda/\lambda_g = (G/L_g) / (Q/L)\]

If there are relatively permanent obstacles to the mobility of the producers from branch to branch, adoption of techniques, etc., the direct price will be altered accordingly, but this is basically it.  So, clearly, there will be some producer $i$ of the commodity with $(G/L_g)/(Q_i/L_i) > p$.  Tough luck!  There are winners and losers here.  Inter-industry, it all hinges on the (Smith) ``effectual demand,'' embedded in the concept of socially necessary labor $L$.  Basically, $L$ is given by technical conditions of production and also by the size of the (solvent) social need (or ``effectual demand'').    But the notion of technical conditions/social need (effectual demand) is something more or less stable, something that only evolves slowly over time.  Not the result of tiny fluctuations in demand/supply.  This is what Smith, Ricardo, and Marx meant -- I'd argue.  This is all very empirically or historically determined.

[Direct price mechanism.  Then production-price mechanism.  Then the modifications due to the other factors at play.
